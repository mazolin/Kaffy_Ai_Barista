# ☕ Kaffy: AI Virtual Barista Concept

**Kaffy** is an intelligent conversational assistant designed to integrate into the Starbucks mobile app. It simplifies the ordering process by allowing users to chat naturally, helping them decide what to drink based on their mood, budget, or dietary needs.

## 🎯 The Problem
Starbucks has a vast menu, and customers often feel overwhelmed or stick to the same order. Finding specific nutritional information (like sugar content) or discovering new combinations takes time.
 
## 💡 The Solution
Kaffy acts as a digital barista living inside a floating button in the app. Users can say:
> *"I need something to wake me up, but low sugar."*
> *"I have a budget of $10, I want a drink and a snack."*

Kaffy processes these requests, checks the menu database for matches, and handles the ordering flow (Pick-up or Delivery).

## ✨ Key Features

* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Understands context, sentiment, and vague requests.
* **Smart Menu Integration:** Knows ingredients, calories, and prices of all items.
* **Dietary Guidance:** Warns about allergens or high sugar content upon request.
* **Cross-Selling:** Suggests food pairings that match the selected drink profile.
* **Seamless UX:** Designed as a non-intrusive chat overlay on the existing app interface.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Conceptual)

* **AI/LLM:** OpenAI API / Gemini API (Fine-tuned on Starbucks Menu Data)
* **Backend:** Python (FastAPI)
* **Frontend:** React Native / Flutter (Prototype)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (Menu & User Preferences)
